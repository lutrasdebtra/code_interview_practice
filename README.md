# Coding Interview Practice

This repository is for my personal solutions to the 6th edition of "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell.

Solutions are not nessesarily optimal or similar to solutions provided in the book.

`main.py` runs all the tests for the various questions, broken down into a seperate testing class per chapter. Each chapter is it's own `.py` file, and any additional code for a chapter is placed in a folder of the same name.
